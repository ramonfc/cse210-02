# Hilo
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won (+100) or lost (-75) based on whether or not the player guessed correctly. The player will start with 300 points, if the player reaches 0 points the game is over.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
